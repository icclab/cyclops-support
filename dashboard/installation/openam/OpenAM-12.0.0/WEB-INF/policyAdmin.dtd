<!-- Policies is a collection of Policy element -->

<!ELEMENT Policies ( Policy+ ) >

<!-- Policy is the root element that defines a named policy rule.
     The attribute "name" provides the policy name, "description" gives
     a brief description for the policy, "active" specifies the
     fact whether this policy is currently active or not. Default
     value is "true". If this value is set to "true" only then 
     this policy is considered during policy evaluation.
     "serviceName" identifies the service name for which the policy is
     applicable. The attribute "referralPolicy" is used to flag the
     policy as a referral policy. A referral policy is used for
     delegation. All action/values defined in the referral policy are
     ignored during policy evaluation. Conversely, all referrals
     defined in a non referral policy are ignored during policy
     evaluation.
     The policy element can have one or more rules (Rule)
     and subjects (Subject) to whom the policy is applied. If the
     subject is empty, the policy does not apply any users. 
     Referrals is collection of Referral(s). Referral is used 
     to facilitate delegating policy definition and/or policy evaluation 
     to a different point such as PeerOrg, SubOrg or a custom plugin.
     Conditions is collection of Condition(s). Condition is used 
     to sepcify restrictions such as time range, auth levels 
     for which the policy applies. ResponseProviders are a collection
     of ResponseProvider(s). ResponseProvider is used to specify the
     response attributes which would be returned as part of the PolicyDecision
     provided the policy applies for the given Subject, ResourceName under
     the specified Conditions(s).Conditions, Subjects, ResponseProviders and 
     Referrals are containers.They can have 0 or more elements. 
     It enables modifying the policies such as removing one elment and adding 
     another element to that container in the policy.
